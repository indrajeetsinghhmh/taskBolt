## How This Project Is Made

- **React Functional Components & Hooks:**  
  The app uses React functional components with hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` to manage state and lifecycle events.

- **Routing with React Router:**  
  Navigation between pages (Home, About, Contact, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service) is handled using React Router DOM for a smooth SPA experience.

- **Task Management Logic:**  
  Tasks are stored in localStorage to persist across sessions. Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete.

- **Date Validation:**  
  The date picker input restricts users from selecting past dates using the `min` attribute dynamically set to todayâ€™s date.

- **Reminder Notifications:**  
  A periodic timer checks tasks and triggers reminders at specific intervals (24h, 12h, 6h, 3h, 1h before due date) using both React Toastify for in-app notifications and the Web Notifications API for device notifications.

- **Scrollbar Hiding:**  
  The entire app container uses inline styles and CSS to hide scrollbars while keeping scrolling functional, providing a cleaner UI.

- **Styling:**  
  Tailwind CSS utility classes are used extensively for responsive, modern, and consistent styling across components.

## Usage

- **Delete a Task:** Click the trash icon to remove a task.
